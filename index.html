            <h1>Sedimentary Rock</h1><br>
        <p>Sedimentary rocks are rocks that are formed from other rocks that have been broken down and that have been compacted and cemented into a rock. Sedimentary rocks usually have a layered pattern.<br><br>
            Sedimentary rocks are formed through 5 steps near the surface. Weathering, erosion, deposition, compaction, and cementation. Weathering, from the sun heats up the rocks so that rain and wind breaks down the rocks into smaller pieces, erosion erodes the rock through wind or water, deposition is when wind, water, or ice transport the sediment to a different location. Compaction is when sediments are being added on top of sediments and on top of even more sediments, therefore compacting the rocks making it compacted. Cementation is when the compacted sediment gets sort of glued together to form a single rock.<br><br>Since sedimentary rocks form at the surface, you can find sedimentary rocks near bodys of water since that's where erosion is happening the most. </p>

            <h1>Igneous Rock</h1><br>
        <p>Igneous rocks are rocks that have been formed when magma from earth's mantle goes to the surface of the earth to harden and become igneous rock. Igneous rocks are usually the results of volcanoes<br><br>
            Igneous rocks go through the process of magma being cooled down and hardens. When magma from earth's mantle reaches the surface, usually through an erupting volcano, the magma takes time to cool down and harden, forming an igneous rock. Magma forms underground, through either regional metamorphism or contact metamorphism. Regional metamorphism is when energy from earth's interior melts the rocks into magma where they can become igneous rocks. Contact metamorphism is when the energy from earth's interior directly melts the rocks forming magma that can become igneous rock.
            <br><br>Since igneous rocks are formed by magma, it would only make sense that igneous rocks are found near volcanoes where the most magma forms. </p>

            <h1>Metamorphic rock</h1><br>
        <p>Metamorphic rocks are a variety of rocks that have been formed as one through heat and pressure. <br><br>
            When metamorphic rocks form, they go through a process of heat and pressure. When rocks are buried deep beneath the Earth's surface, great pressure and tremendous heat change these rocks into new rocks containing different minerals. This all happens underground in earth's interior and after this happens, we have metamorphic rocks.
            <br><br>Since metamorphic rocks happen due to a lot of heat and pressure, it would make sense to find metamorphic rocks near mountain ranges, where there is a crazy amount of pressure. </p>
